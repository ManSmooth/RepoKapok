 #**Computer Programming Lab Collection**
 ##Notice
 These aren't flawless since most of them were done in like what, *10 minutes?*
 ~~(Except for the mini project, of course)~~
 
 ###Note to visitors
 It's okay to look at these Lab files if your intent is **to study and not copy**.
 If you're going to copy these, at least be proficient in each of the subject required in each lab.
